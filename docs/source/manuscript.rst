Introduction

Results
-------

Libraries: MNase (public), H3K4me3, H3K27Ac, H3K9me3, RNA-seq(public)

Fragment sizes

Nucleosome locations

MNase digested ChIP-seq improves resolution over sonicated ChIP-seq
MNase digested ChIP-seq are coherent with sonicated ChIP-seq

Empty spaces are not bound by proteins (wide range MNase show so)

H3K4me3 is proportional to exon inclusion

MNase and H3K9me3 are slightly enriched on spliced-in exons
