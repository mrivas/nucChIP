Chromatins, prepared by reconstitution with either chicken or frog histones, were separately digested to mononucleosomes using either micrococcal nuclease (MNase) or caspase-activated DNase (CAD). Both enzymes preferentially cleave internucleosomal (linker) DNA, although they do so by markedly different mechanisms. MNase has hitherto been very widely used to map nucleosomes, although concerns have been raised over its potential to introduce bias. Having identified the locations and quantified the strength of both the chicken or frog histone octamer binding sites on each DNA, the results obtained with the two enzymes were compared using a variety of criteria. Both enzymes displayed sequence specificity in their preferred cleavage sites, although the nature of this selectivity was distinct for the two enzymes. In addition, nucleosomes produced by CAD nuclease are 8-10 bp longer than those produced with MNase, with the CAD cleavage sites tending to be 4-5 bp further out from the nucleosomal dyad than the corresponding MNase cleavage sites. Despite these notable differences in cleavage behaviour, the two nucleases identified essentially equivalent patterns of nucleosome positioning sites on each of the DNAs tested, an observation that was independent of the histone type. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant.},<br />author = {Allan, James and Fraser, Ross M and Owen-Hughes, Tom and Keszenman-Pereyra, David},<br />doi = {10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.043},<br />issn = {1089-8638},<br />journaltitle = {Journal of molecular biology},<br />keywords = {Animals,Binding Sites,Chickens,Chickens: genetics,Chromatin,Chromatin: metabolism,Deoxyribonucleases,Deoxyribonucleases: chemistry,Deoxyribonucleases: metabolism,Histones,Histones: genetics,Histones: metabolism,Lactoglobulins,MNase is not sequence bias,Micrococcal Nuclease,Micrococcal Nuclease: chemistry,Micrococcal Nuclease: metabolism,Models, Molecular,Nucleosomes,Nucleosomes: genetics,Nucleosomes: metabolism,Protein Conformation,Ranidae,Ranidae: genetics,Restriction Mapping,Restriction Mapping: methods},<br />mendeley-tags = {MNase is not sequence bias},<br />month = mar,<br />number = {3},<br />pages = {152--64},<br />pmid = {22310051},<br />title = {{Micrococcal nuclease does not substantially bias nucleosome mapping.}},<br />url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283612000976},<br />volume = {417},<br />year = {2012}<br />}<br /></div></div><div id='Barski2007' class='problem severe0'><h2>Barski2007 (article)</h2> <div class='links'> <a href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&q=Highresolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome' target='_blank'>Scholar</a> |  <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=Highresolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome' target='_blank'>Google</a> |  <a href='http://dblp.org/search/index.php#query=Highresolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome' target='_blank'>DBLP</a> |  <a href='http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText=Highresolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome' target='_blank'>IEEE</a> |  <a href='http://dl.acm.org/results.cfm?nquery=Highresolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome' target='_blank'>ACM</a></div><div class='reference'>High-resolution profiling of histone methylations in the human genome.</div><ul></ul><form class='problem_control'><label>checked</label><input type='checkbox' class='checked'/></form><div class='bibtex_toggle'>Current BibLaTex Entry</div><div class='bibtex'>@article{Barski2007,<br />abstract = {Histone modifications are implicated in influencing gene expression. We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications.

Here, we describe the development of an improved nucleosome-positioning algorithm-iNPS-which achieves significantly better performance than the widely used NPS package. By determining nucleosome boundaries more precisely and merging or separating shoulder peaks based on local MNase-seq signals, iNPS can unambiguously detect 60\% more nucleosomes. The detected nucleosomes display better nucleosome 'widths' and neighbouring centre-centre distance distributions, giving rise to sharper patterns and better phasing of average nucleosome profiles and higher consistency between independent data subsets. In addition to its unique advantage in classifying nucleosomes by shape to reveal their different biological properties, iNPS also achieves higher significance and lower false positive rates than previously published methods. The application of iNPS to T-cell activation data demonstrates a greater ability to facilitate detection of nucleosome repositioning, uncovering additional biological features underlying the activation process.},<br />author = {Chen, Weizhong and Liu, Yi and Zhu, Shanshan and Green, Christopher D and Wei, Gang and Han, Jing-Dong Jackie},<br />doi = {10.1038/ncomms5909},<br />isbn = {doi:10.1038/ncomms5909},<br />issn = {2041-1723},<br />journaltitle = {Nature communications},<br />language = {en},<br />month = jan,<br />pages = {4909},<br />pmid = {25233085},<br />publisher = {Nature Publishing Group},<br />title = {{Improved nucleosome-positioning algorithm iNPS for accurate nucleosome positioning from sequencing data.}},<br />url = {http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140918/ncomms5909/full/ncomms5909.html},<br />volume = {5},<br />year = {2014}<br />}<br /></div></div><div id='Haberle2014' class='problem severe0'><h2>Haberle2014 (article)</h2> <div class='links'> <a href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&q=Two independent transcription initiation codes overlap on vertebrate core promoters' target='_blank'>Scholar</a> |  <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=Two independent transcription initiation codes overlap on vertebrate core promoters' target='_blank'>Google</a> |  <a href='http://dblp.org/search/index.php#query=Two independent transcription initiation codes overlap on vertebrate core promoters' target='_blank'>DBLP</a> |  <a href='http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText=Two independent transcription initiation codes overlap on vertebrate core promoters' target='_blank'>IEEE</a> |  <a href='http://dl.acm.org/results.cfm?nquery=Two independent transcription initiation codes overlap on vertebrate core promoters' target='_blank'>ACM</a></div><div class='reference'>Two independent transcription initiation codes overlap on vertebrate core promoters.</div><ul></ul><form class='problem_control'><label>checked</label><input type='checkbox' class='checked'/></form><div class='bibtex_toggle'>Current BibLaTex Entry</div><div class='bibtex'>@article{Haberle2014,<br />abstract = {A core promoter is a stretch of DNA surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) that integrates regulatory inputs and recruits general transcription factors to initiate transcription. The nature and causative relationship of the DNA sequence and chromatin signals that govern the selection of most TSSs by RNA polymerase II remain unresolved. Maternal to zygotic transition represents the most marked change of the transcriptome repertoire in the vertebrate life cycle. Early embryonic development in zebrafish is characterized by a series of transcriptionally silent cell cycles regulated by inherited maternal gene products: zygotic genome activation commences at the tenth cell cycle, marking the mid-blastula transition. This transition provides a unique opportunity to study the rules of TSS selection and the hierarchy of events linking transcription initiation with key chromatin modifications. We analysed TSS usage during zebrafish early embryonic development at high resolution using cap analysis of gene expression, and determined the positions of H3K4me3-marked promoter-associated nucleosomes. Here we show that the transition from the maternal to zygotic transcriptome is characterized by a switch between two fundamentally different modes of defining transcription initiation, which drive the dynamic change of TSS usage and promoter shape. A maternal-specific TSS selection, which requires an A/T-rich (W-box) motif, is replaced with a zygotic TSS selection grammar characterized by broader patterns of dinucleotide enrichments, precisely aligned with the first downstream (+1) nucleosome. The developmental dynamics of the H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes reveal their DNA-sequence-associated positioning at promoters before zygotic transcription and subsequent transcription-independent adjustment to the final position downstream of the zygotic TSS. The two TSS-defining grammars coexist, often physically overlapping, in core promoters of constitutively expressed genes to enable their expression in the two regulatory environments. The dissection of overlapping core promoter determinants represents a framework for future studies of promoter structure and function across different regulatory contexts.},<br />author = {Haberle, Vanja and Li, Nan and Hadzhiev, Yavor and Plessy, Charles and Previti, Christopher and Nepal, Chirag and Gehrig, Jochen and Dong, Xianjun and Akalin, Altuna and Suzuki, Ana Maria and van IJcken, Wilfred F J and Armant, Olivier and Ferg, Marco and Str\"{a}hle, Uwe and Carninci, Piero and M\"{u}ller, Ferenc and Lenhard, Boris},<br />doi = {10.1038/nature12974},<br />issn = {1476-4687},<br />journaltitle = {Nature},<br />keywords = {Animals,Base Sequence,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Embryo, Nonmammalian: embryology,Embryo, Nonmammalian: metabolism,Female,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental: genetic,Histones,Histones: metabolism,Methylation,Mothers,Nucleosomes,Nucleosomes: genetics,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Promoter Regions, Genetic: genetics,Sequence based code for transcription,Transcription Initiation Site,Transcription Initiation, Genetic,Transcriptome,Transcriptome: genetics,Zebrafish,Zebrafish: embryology,Zebrafish: genetics,Zygote,Zygote: metabolism},<br />mendeley-tags = {Sequence based code for transcription},<br />month = mar,<br />number = {7492},<br />pages = {381--5},<br />pmid = {24531765},<br />publisher = {Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In living cells this organization is determined by multiple factors, including the action of chromatin remodellers, competition with site-specific DNA-binding proteins, and the DNA sequence preferences of the nucleosomes themselves. However, it has been difficult to estimate the relative importance of each of these mechanisms in vivo, because in vivo nucleosome maps reflect the combined action of all influencing factors. Here we determine the importance of nucleosome DNA sequence preferences experimentally by measuring the genome-wide occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA. The resulting map, in which nucleosome occupancy is governed only by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, is similar to in vivo nucleosome maps generated in three different growth conditions. In vitro, nucleosome depletion is evident at many transcription factor binding sites and around gene start and end sites, indicating that nucleosome depletion at these sites in vivo is partly encoded in the genome. We confirm these results with a micrococcal nuclease-independent experiment that measures the relative affinity of nucleosomes for approximately 40,000 double-stranded 150-base-pair oligonucleotides. Using our in vitro data, we devise a computational model of nucleosome sequence preferences that is significantly correlated with in vivo nucleosome occupancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results indicate that the intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes have a central role in determining the organization of nucleosomes in vivo.},<br />author = {Kaplan, Noam and Moore, Irene K and Fondufe-Mittendorf, Yvonne and Gossett, Andrea J and Tillo, Desiree and Field, Yair and LeProust, Emily M and Hughes, Timothy R and Lieb, Jason D and Widom, Jonathan and Segal, Eran},<br />doi = {10.1038/nature07667},<br />file = {:home/marcelo/.local/share/data/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Kaplan et al. - 2009 - The DNA-encoded nucleosome organization of a eukaryotic genome.pdf:pdf},<br />issn = {1476-4687},<br />journaltitle = {Nature},<br />keywords = {Animals,Base Sequence,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans: genetics,Chickens,Computational Biology,Computer Simulation,DNA leads nucleosome positioning,Eukaryotic Cells,Eukaryotic Cells: metabolism,Genome, Fungal,Genome, Fungal: genetics,Micrococcal Nuclease,Micrococcal Nuclease: metabolism,Nucleosomes,Nucleosomes: genetics,Nucleosomes: metabolism,RNA, Messenger,RNA, Messenger: genetics,RNA, Messenger: metabolism,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Saccharomyces cerevisiae: genetics,Saccharomyces cerevisiae: growth \& development,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Transcription Factors,Transcription Factors: metabolism},<br />mendeley-tags = {DNA leads nucleosome positioning},<br />month = mar,<br />number = {7236},<br />pages = {362--6},<br />pmid = {19092803},<br />publisher = {Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Studying each modification in five human cell lines including the ENCODE Consortium common cell lines GM06990 (lymphoblastoid) and HeLa-S3, as well as K562, HFL-1, and MOLT4, we identified clear patterns of histone modification profiles with respect to genomic features.

The locations and occupancies of a principle component of chromatin, nucleosomes, are typically assayed through use of enzymatic digestion with micrococcal nuclease (MNase). MNase is an endo-exo nuclease that preferentially digests naked DNA and the DNA in linkers between nucleosomes, thus enriching for nucleosome-associated DNA. To determine nucleosome organization genome-wide, DNA remaining from MNase digestion is sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies (MNase-seq). Unfortunately, the results of MNase-seq can vary dramatically due to technical differences and this confounds comparisons between MNase-seq experiments, such as examining condition-dependent chromatin organizations.<br />RESULTS: In this study we use MNase digestion simulations to demonstrate how MNase-seq signals can vary for different nucleosome configuration when experiments are performed with different extents of MNase digestion. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. The presence of this neighborhood effect ultimately confounds comparisons between different MNase-seq experiments. To address this issue we present a standardized chromatin preparation which controls for technical variance between MNase-based chromatin preparations and enables the collection of similarly sampled (matched) chromatin populations. Standardized preparation of chromatin includes a normalization step for DNA input into MNase digestions and close matching of the extent of digestion between each chromatin preparation using gel densitometry analysis. The protocol also includes directions for successful pairing with multiplex sequencing reactions.<br />CONCLUSIONS: We validated our method by comparing the experiment-to-experiment variation between biological replicates of chromatin preparations from S. cerevisiae. Results from our matched preparation consistently produced MNase-seq datasets that were more closely correlated than other unstandardized approaches. Additionally, we validated the ability of our approach at enabling accurate downstream comparisons of chromatin structures, by comparing the specificity of detecting Tup1-dependent chromatin remodeling events in comparisons between matched and un-matched wild-type and tup1$\Delta$ MNase-seq datasets. Our matched MNase-seq datasets demonstrated a significant reduction in non-specific (technical) differences between experiments and were able to maximize the detection of biologically-relevant (Tup1-dependent) changes in chromatin structure.},<br />author = {Rizzo, Jason M and Bard, Jonathan E and Buck, Michael J},<br />doi = {10.1186/1471-2199-13-15},<br />file = {:home/marcelo/.local/share/data/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Rizzo, Bard, Buck - 2012 - Standardized collection of MNase-seq experiments enables unbiased dataset comparisons.pdf:pdf},<br />issn = {1471-2199},<br />journaltitle = {BMC molecular biology},<br />keywords = {Biases on MNase data,Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly,Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly: genetics,DNA,DNA: genetics,DNA: metabolism,Genetic Techniques,High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,Micrococcal Nuclease,Micrococcal Nuclease: diagnostic use,Micrococcal Nuclease: metabolism,Nucleosomes,Nucleosomes: genetics,Reproducibility of Results,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Saccharomyces cerevisiae: genetics},<br />mendeley-tags = {Biases on MNase data},<br />month = jan,<br />number = {1},<br />pages = {15},<br />pmid = {22559821},<br />title = {{Standardized collection of MNase-seq experiments enables unbiased dataset comparisons.}},<br />url = {http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/13/15},<br />volume = {13},<br />year = {2012}<br />}<br /></div></div><div id='Stasevich2014' class='problem severe0'><h2>Stasevich2014 (article)</h2> <div class='links'> <a href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&q=Regulation of RNA polymerase II activation by histone acetylation in single living cells' target='_blank'>Scholar</a> |  <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=Regulation of RNA polymerase II activation by histone acetylation in single living cells' target='_blank'>Google</a> |  <a href='http://dblp.org/search/index.php#query=Regulation of RNA polymerase II activation by histone acetylation in single living cells' target='_blank'>DBLP</a> |  <a href='http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText=Regulation of RNA polymerase II activation by histone acetylation in single living cells' target='_blank'>IEEE</a> |  <a href='http://dl.acm.org/results.cfm?nquery=Regulation of RNA polymerase II activation by histone acetylation in single living cells' target='_blank'>ACM</a></div><div class='reference'>Regulation of RNA polymerase II activation by histone acetylation in single living cells</div><ul></ul><form class='problem_control'><label>checked</label><input type='checkbox' class='checked'/></form><div class='bibtex_toggle'>Current BibLaTex Entry</div><div class='bibtex'>@article{Stasevich2014,<br />author = {Stasevich, Timothy J. and Hayashi-Takanaka, Yoko and Sato, Yuko and Maehara, Kazumitsu and Ohkawa, Yasuyuki and Sakata-Sogawa, Kumiko and Tokunaga, Makio and Nagase, Takahiro and Nozaki, Naohito and McNally, James G. and Kimura, Hiroshi},<br />doi = {10.1038/nature13714},<br />issn = {0028-0836},<br />journaltitle = {Nature},<br />keywords = {H3K27Ac as activator},<br />mendeley-tags = {H3K27Ac as activator},<br />month = sep,<br />number = {7530},<br />pages = {272--275},<br />publisher = {Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, we have dissected the linkages between DNA methylation (5mC), hydroxymethylation (5hmC), nucleosome repositioning, and binding of the transcription factor CTCF during this process. By integrating MNase-seq and ChIP-seq experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their differentiated counterparts with biophysical modeling, we found that the interplay between these factors depends on their genomic context. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. The few remaining methylated CpG dinucleotides are preferentially associated with nucleosomes. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Outside CpG islands, binding of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5mC to 5hmC, is associated with labile, MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. Such nucleosomes are poised for eviction in ESCs and become stably bound in differentiated cells where the TET1 and 5hmC levels go down. This process regulates a class of CTCF binding sites outside CpG islands that are occupied by CTCF in ESCs but lose the protein during differentiation. We rationalize this cell type-dependent targeting of CTCF with a quantitative biophysical model of competitive binding with the histone octamer, depending on the TET1, 5hmC, and 5mC state.},<br />author = {Teif, Vladimir B and Beshnova, Daria A and Vainshtein, Yevhen and Marth, Caroline and Mallm, Jan-Philipp and H\"{o}fer, Thomas and Rippe, Karsten},<br />doi = {10.1101/gr.164418.113},<br />issn = {1549-5469},<br />journaltitle = {Genome research},<br />keywords = {H3K9me3,Nucleosomal ChIP-seq: H3K4me3},<br />mendeley-tags = {H3K9me3,Nucleosomal ChIP-seq: H3K4me3},<br />month = aug,<br />number = {8},<br />pages = {1285--95},<br />pmid = {24812327},<br />title = {{Nucleosome repositioning links DNA (de)methylation and differential CTCF binding during stem cell development.}},<br />url = {http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2014/05/08/gr.164418.113.abstract},<br />volume = {24},<br />year = {2014}<br />}<br /></div></div><div id='Voigt2012' class='problem severe0'><h2>Voigt2012 (article)</h2> <div class='links'> <a href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&q=Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes' target='_blank'>Scholar</a> |  <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes' target='_blank'>Google</a> |  <a href='http://dblp.org/search/index.php#query=Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes' target='_blank'>DBLP</a> |  <a href='http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText=Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes' target='_blank'>IEEE</a> |  <a href='http://dl.acm.org/results.cfm?nquery=Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes' target='_blank'>ACM</a></div><div class='reference'>Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes.</div><ul></ul><form class='problem_control'><label>checked</label><input type='checkbox' class='checked'/></form><div class='bibtex_toggle'>Current BibLaTex Entry</div><div class='bibtex'>@article{Voigt2012,<br />abstract = {Mononucleosomes, the basic building blocks of chromatin, contain two copies of each core histone. The associated posttranslational modifications regulate essential chromatin-dependent processes, yet whether each histone copy is identically modified in vivo is unclear. We demonstrate that nucleosomes in embryonic stem cells, fibroblasts, and cancer cells exist in both symmetrically and asymmetrically modified populations for histone H3 lysine 27 di/trimethylation (H3K27me2/3) and H4K20me1. Further, we obtained direct physical evidence for bivalent nucleosomes carrying H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 along with H3K27me3, albeit on opposite H3 tails. Bivalency at target genes was resolved upon differentiation of ES cells. Polycomb repressive complex 2-mediated methylation of H3K27 was inhibited when nucleosomes contain symmetrically, but not asymmetrically, placed H3K4me3 or H3K36me3. These findings uncover a potential mechanism for the incorporation of bivalent features into nucleosomes and demonstrate how asymmetry might set the stage to diversify functional nucleosome states.},<br />author = {Voigt, Philipp and LeRoy, Gary and Drury, William J and Zee, Barry M and Son, Jinsook and Beck, David B and Young, Nicolas L and Garcia, Benjamin A and Reinberg, Danny},<br />doi = {10.1016/j.cell.2012.09.002},<br />file = {:home/marcelo/.local/share/data/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Voigt et al. - 2012 - Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes.pdf:pdf},<br />issn = {1097-4172},<br />journaltitle = {Cell},<br />keywords = {Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Embryonic Stem Cells,Embryonic Stem Cells: metabolism,Evidence of cohexitence of bivalent nucleosomes,Fibroblasts,Fibroblasts: metabolism,HeLa Cells,Histone Code,Histones,Histones: chemistry,Histones: metabolism,Humans,Mice,Molecular Sequence Data,Nucleosomes,Nucleosomes: metabolism,Polycomb-Group Proteins,Polycomb-Group Proteins: metabolism,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Protein Processing, Post-Translational},<br />mendeley-tags = {Evidence of cohexitence of bivalent nucleosomes},<br />month = sep,<br />number = {1},<br />pages = {181--93},<br />pmid = {23021224},<br />title = {{Asymmetrically modified nucleosomes.}},<br />url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412010677},<br />volume = {151},<br />year = {2012}<br />}<br /></div></div><div id='Waterston2002' class='problem severe0'><h2>Waterston2002 (article)</h2> <div class='links'> <a href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&q=Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome' target='_blank'>Scholar</a> |  <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome' target='_blank'>Google</a> |  <a href='http://dblp.org/search/index.php#query=Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome' target='_blank'>DBLP</a> |  <a href='http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?queryText=Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome' target='_blank'>IEEE</a> |  <a href='http://dl.acm.org/results.cfm?nquery=Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome' target='_blank'>ACM</a></div><div class='reference'>Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome.</div><ul></ul><form class='problem_control'><label>checked</label><input type='checkbox' class='checked'/></form><div class='bibtex_toggle'>Current BibLaTex Entry</div><div class='bibtex'>@article{Waterston2002,<br />abstract = {The sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key experimental tool for biomedical research.

accessibility of DNA binding proteins to the genome. Genome-wide nucleosome binding profiles have identified a canonical nucleosome organization at gene promoters, where arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes emanate from nucleosome-depleted regions. The mechanisms of formation and the function of canonical promoter nucleosome organization remain unclear. Here we analyze the genome-wide location of nucleosomes during zebrafish embryogenesis and show that well-positioned nucleosome arrays appear on thousands of promoters during the activation of the zygotic genome. The formation of canonical promoter nucleosome organization is independent of DNA sequence preference, transcriptional elongation, and robust RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Instead, canonical promoter nucleosome organization correlates with the presence of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and affects future transcriptional activation. These findings reveal that genome activation is central to the organization of nucleosome arrays during early embryogenesis.},<br />author = {Zhang, Yong and Vastenhouw, Nadine L and Feng, Jianxing and Fu, Kai and Wang, Chenfei and Ge, Ying and Pauli, Andrea and van Hummelen, Paul and Schier, Alexander F and Liu, X Shirley},<br />doi = {10.1101/gr.157750.113},<br />file = {:home/marcelo/.local/share/data/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Zhang et al. - 2014 - Canonical nucleosome organization at promoters forms during genome activation(2).pdf:pdf},<br />issn = {1549-5469},<br />journaltitle = {Genome research},<br />keywords = {Animals,DNA-Binding Proteins,DNA-Binding Proteins: genetics,Embryonic Development,Embryonic Development: genetics,Genome,Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase,Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase: genetics,Mnase ChIP-seq on zebrafish.
